# what i did, 4 points given
* I made the dashboard first
* then I made a fake reviews json file and used it
* used the fake json file in reviews route and also showed in home by slicing to 3
* finnished the assignment by doing an optional task, making it responsive, I didn't got much time to do active params and stuffs but atleast made it responsive using tailwind!!
